## üìåDescription

This project is to understand what is an API and how use it, it was made in the software development program of [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.fr/).


<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to <a href="https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/">explain to anyone</a>, **without the help of Google:**

## General

* What REST means
* What API means
* What CORS means
* What is an API
* What is a REST API
* What are other type of APIs
* Which is the HTTP method to retrieve resource(s)
* Which is the HTTP method to create a resource
* Which is the HTTP method to update resource
* Which is the HTTP method to delete resource
* How to request REST API

# Requirements

## Python Scripts

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' `and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Python Unit Tests

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
* You have to use the unittest [module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)
* All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
* All your test files and folders should start by `test_`
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base_model.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
* You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don‚Äôt miss any edge cases

## GitHub

**There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.**
